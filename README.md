Hi!

This is just a mini Python project where I made a Buzzfeed-style BTS quiz to see which BTS member you would be most similar to. 
The questions and answers are based on various sources I consulted on YouTube (e.g. Buzzfeed) & my two years of being in the BTS fandom. 
Disclaimer: this quiz is just for fun and does not necessarily represent the views of the members, so don't take it too seriously. 

btsmem.py contains the code for running the quiz & btsmemdict.py contains the questions and answers used in the quiz. 
You can run this quiz by downloading this project and running btsmem.py in the Python terminal.
